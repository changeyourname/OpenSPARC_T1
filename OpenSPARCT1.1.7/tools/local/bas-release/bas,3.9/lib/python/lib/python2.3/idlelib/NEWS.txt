  SF IDLEfork patch 682347.


What's New in IDLE 1.0b2?
===================================

*Release date: 29-Jun-2003*

- Extend AboutDialog.ViewFile() to support file encodings.  Make the CREDITS
  file Latin-1.

- Updated the About dialog to reflect re-integration into Python.  Provide
  buttons to display Python's NEWS, License, and Credits, plus additional
  buttons for IDLE's README and NEWS.

- TextViewer() now has a third parameter which allows inserting text into the
  viewer instead of reading from a file.

- (Created the .../Lib/idlelib directory in the Python CVS, which is a clone of
  IDLEfork modified to install in the Python environment.  The code in the
  interrupt module has been moved to thread.interrupt_main(). )

- Printing the Shell window was failing if it was not saved first SF 748975

- When using the Search in Files dialog, if the user had a selection
  highlighted in his Editor window, insert it into the dialog search field.

- The Python Shell entry was disappearing from the Windows menu.

- Update the Windows file list when a file name change occurs

- Change to File / Open Module: always pop up the dialog, using the current
  selection as the default value.  This is easier to use habitually.

- Avoided a problem with starting the subprocess when 'localhost' doesn't
  resolve to the user's loopback interface.  SF 747772

- Fixed an issue with highlighted errors never de-colorizing.  SF 747677.  Also
  improved notification of Tabnanny Token Error.

- File / New will by default save in the directory of the Edit window from
  which it was initiated.  SF 748973 Guido van Rossum patch.


What's New in IDLEfork 0.9b1?
===================================

*Release date: 02-Jun-2003*

- The current working directory of the execution environment (and shell
  following completion of execution) is now that of the module being run. 

- Added the delete-exitfunc option to config-main.def.  (This option is not
  included in the Options dialog.)  Setting this to True (the default) will
  cause IDLE to not run sys.exitfunc/atexit when the subprocess exits.

- IDLE now preserves the line ending codes when editing a file produced on
  a different platform. SF 661759,  SF 538584

- Reduced default editor font size to 10 point and increased window height
  to provide a better initial impression on Windows.

- Options / Fonts/Tabs / Set Base Editor Font: List box was not highlighting
  the default font when first installed on Windows.  SF 661676

- Added Autosave feature: when user runs code from edit window, if the file
  has been modified IDLE will silently save it if Autosave is enabled.  The
  option is set in the Options dialog, and the default is to prompt the
  user to save the file.   SF 661318 Bruce Sherwood patch.

- Improved the RESTART annotation in the shell window when the user restarts
  the shell while it is generating output.  Also improved annotation when user
  repeatedly hammers the Ctrl-F6 restart.

- Allow IDLE to run when not installed and cwd is not the IDLE directory
  SF Patch 686254 "Run IDLEfork from any directory without set-up" - Raphael

- When a module is run from an EditorWindow: if its directory is not in
  sys.path, prepend it.  This allows the module to import other modules in
  the same directory.  Do the same for a script run from the command line.

- Correctly restart the subprocess if it is running user code and the user
  attempts to run some other module or restarts the shell.  Do the same if
  the link is broken and it is possible to restart the subprocess and re-
  connect to the GUI.   SF RFE 661321.

- Improved exception reporting when running commands or scripts from the
  command line.

- Added a -n command line switch to start IDLE without the subprocess.
  Removed the Shell menu when running in that mode.  Updated help messages.

- Added a comment to the shell startup header to indicate when IDLE is not
  using the subprocess.

- Restore the ability to run without the subprocess.  This can be important for
  some platforms or configurations.  (Running without the subprocess allows the
  debugger to trace through parts of IDLE itself, which may or may not be
  desirable, depending on your point of view.  In addition, the traditional
  reload/import tricks must be use if user source code is changed.)  This is
  helpful for developing IDLE using IDLE, because one instance can be used to
  edit the code and a separate instance run to test changes.  (Multiple
  concurrent IDLE instances with subprocesses is a future feature)

- Improve the error message a user gets when saving a file with non-ASCII
  characters and no source encoding is specified.  Done by adding a dialog
  'EncodingMessage', which contains the line to add in a fixed-font entry
  widget, and which has a button to add that line to the file automatically.
  Also, add a configuration option 'EditorWindow/encoding', which has three
  possible values: none, utf-8, and locale. None is the default: IDLE will show
  this dialog when non-ASCII characters are encountered. utf-8 means that files
  with non-ASCII characters are saved as utf-8-with-bom. locale means that
  files are saved in the locale's encoding; the dialog is only displayed if the
  source contains characters outside the locale's charset.  SF 710733 - Loewis

- Improved I/O response by tweaking the wait parameter in various
  calls to signal.signal().

- Implemented a threaded subprocess which allows interrupting a pass 
  loop in user code using the 'interrupt' extension.  User code runs
  in MainThread, while the RPCServer is handled by SockThread.  This is
  necessary because Windows doesn't support signals.

- Implemented the 'interrupt' extension module, which allows a subthread
  to raise a KeyboardInterrupt in the main thread.

- Attempting to save the shell raised an error related to saving
  breakpoints, which are not implemented in the shell

- Provide a correct message when 'exit' or 'quit' are entered at the
  IDLE command prompt  SF 695861

- Eliminate extra blank line in shell output caused by not flushing
  stdout when user code ends with an unterminated print. SF 695861

- Moved responsibility for exception formatting (i.e. pruning IDLE internal
  calls) out of rpc.py into the client and server.

- Exit IDLE cleanly even when doing subprocess I/O

- Handle subprocess interrupt with an RPC message.  

- Restart the subprocess if it terminates itself. (VPython programs do that)

- Support subclassing of exceptions, including in the shell, by moving the 
  exception formatting to the subprocess.



What's New in IDLEfork 0.9 Alpha 2?
===================================

*Release date: 27-Jan-2003*

- Updated INSTALL.txt to claify use of the python2 rpm.

- Improved formatting in IDLE Help.

- Run menu: Replace "Run Script" with "Run Module".

- Code encountering an unhandled exception under the debugger now shows
  the correct traceback, with IDLE internal levels pruned out.

- If an exception occurs entirely in IDLE, don't prune the IDLE internal
  modules from the traceback displayed.

- Class Browser and Path Browser now use Alt-Key-2 for vertical zoom.

- IDLE icons will now install correctly even when setup.py is run from the
  build directory

- Class Browser now compatible with Python2.3 version of pyclbr.py

- Left cursor move in presence of selected text now moves from left end
  of the selection.

- Add Meta keybindings to "IDLE Classic Windows" to handle reversed
  Alt/Meta on some Linux distros.

- Change default: IDLE now starts with Python Shell.

- Removed the File Path from the Additional Help Sources scrolled list.

- Add capability to access Additional Help Sources on the web if the 
  Help File Path begins with //http or www.  (Otherwise local path is
  validated, as before.)

- Additional Help Sources were not being posted on the Help menu in the
  order entered.  Implement sorting the list by [HelpFiles] 'option' 
  number.

- Add Browse button to New Help Source dialog.  Arrange to start in 
  Python/Doc if platform is Windows, otherwise start in current directory.

- Put the Additional Help Sources directly on the Help menu instead of in
  an Extra Help cascade menu.  Rearrange the Help menu so the Additional
  Help Sources come last.  Update help.txt appropriately.

- Fix Tk root pop-ups in configSectionNameDialog.py  and configDialog.py

- Uniform capitalization in General tab of ConfigDialog, update the doc string.

- Fix bug in ConfigDialog where SaveAllChangedConfig() was unexpectedly
  deleting Additional Help Sources from the user's config file.

- Make configHelpSourceEdit OK button the default and bind <Return>

- Fix Tk root pop-ups in configHelpSourceEdit: error dialogs not attached
  to parents.

- Use os.startfile() to open both Additional Help and Python Help on the
  Windows platform.  The application associated with the file type will act as
  the viewer.  Windows help files (.chm) are now supported via the
  Settings/General/Additional Help facility.

- If Python Help files are installed locally on Linux, use them instead of
  accessing python.org.

- Make the methods for finding the Python help docs more robust, and make
  them work in the installed configuration, also.  

- On the Save Before Run dialog, make the OK button the default.  One
  less mouse action!

- Add a method: EditorWindow.get_geometry() for future use in implementing
  window location persistence.

- Removed the "Help/Advice" menu entry.  Thanks, David!  We'll remember!

- Change the "Classic Windows" theme's paste key to be <ctrl-v>.

- Rearrange the Shell menu to put Stack Viewer entries adjacent.

- Add the ability to restart the subprocess interpreter from the shell window;
  add an associated menu entry "Shell/Restart" with binding Control-F6.  Update
  IDLE help.

- Upon a restart, annotate the shell window with a "restart boundary".  Add a
  shell window menu "Shell/View Restart" with binding F6 to jump to the most
  recent restart boundary.

- Add Shell menu to Python Shell; change "Settings" to "Options".

- Remove incorrect comment in setup.py: IDLEfork is now installed as a package.

- Add INSTALL.txt, HISTORY.txt, NEWS.txt to installed configuration.

- In installer text, fix reference to Visual Python, should be VPython.
  Properly credit David Scherer.

- Modified idle, idle.py, idle.pyw to improve exception handling.


What's New in IDLEfork 0.9 Alpha 1?
===================================

*Release date: 31-Dec-2002* 

- First release of major new functionality.  For further details refer to
  Idle-dev and/or the Sourceforge CVS.

- Adapted to the Mac platform.

- Overhauled the IDLE startup options and revised the idle -h help message,
  which provides details of command line usage.

- Multiple bug fixes and usability enhancements.

- Introduced the new RPC implementation, which includes a debugger.  The output
  of user code is to the shell, and the shell may be used to inspect the
  environment after the run has finished.  (In version 0.8.1 the shell
  environment was separate from the environment of the user code.)

- Introduced the configuration GUI and a new About dialog.

- Removed David Scherer's Remote Procedure Call code and replaced with Guido
  van Rossum's.  GvR code has support for the IDLE debugger and uses the shell
  to inspect the environment of code Run from an Edit window.  Files removed:
  ExecBinding.py, loader.py, protocol.py, Remote.py, spawn.py
