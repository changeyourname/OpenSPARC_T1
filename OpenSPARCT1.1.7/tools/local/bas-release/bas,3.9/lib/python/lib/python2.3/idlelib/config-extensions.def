# IDLE reads several config files to determine user preferences.  This
# file is the default configuration file for IDLE extensions settings.
#
# Each extension must have at least one section, named after the extension
# module. This section must contain an 'enable' item (=1 to enable the
# extension, =0 to disable it) and also contains any other general
# configuration items for the extension. Each extension may also define up to
# two optional sections named ExtensionName_bindings and
# ExtensionName_cfgBindings. If present, ExtensionName_bindings defines virtual
# event bindings for the extension that are not sensibly re-configurable. If
# present, ExtensionName_cfgBindings defines virtual event bindings for the
# extension that may be sensibly re-configured.

# Currently it is necessary to manually modify this file to change extension
# key bindings.  Note: If a keybinding is already in use when the extension is
# loaded, the extension's virtual event's keybinding will be set to ''.

# See config-keys.def for notes on specifying keys.
