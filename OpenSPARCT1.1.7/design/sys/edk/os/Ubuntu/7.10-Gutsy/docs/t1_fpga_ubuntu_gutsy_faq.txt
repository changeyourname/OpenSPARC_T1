1.0) Which version of Ubuntu distribution was used to create the ramdisk image.

    Ubuntu 7.10 Gutsy Gibbon binaries were used to create the ramdisk image.

    Use the following URL for more information about this release.
    http://releases.ubuntu.com/7.10/

    Ubuntu was installed on a UltraSPARC-T1 system using the following network boot image.
    http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/gutsy/main/installer-sparc/current/images/sparc64/netboot/2.6/boot.img

1.1) What is the root password.

     root

1.2) What is the guest account password.

     guest

1.3) How do I specify the root device in the boot command

     ok boot Linux root=/dev/sunhv_disk

1.4) How do I connect the t1_fpga system to the network

   The default IP address and the network configuration may not be appropriate
   to the network to which the t1_fpga system is to be connected.

   There are two ways of changing the IP address and the network configuration of 
   the t1_fpga system.

   1) Permanently change the IP address and the network configuration in the ramdisk image.
   
       Modify the following files in the ramdisk image appropriately

       /etc/network/interfaces
       /etc/hosts
       /etc/resolv.conf
       /etc/networks

   2) Temporarily change the IP address and the network configuration after booting 
      the t1_fpga system with the default IP address and the network configuration.

       Disconnect the t1_fpga system from the network (from the ethernet switch)
       but keep the ethernet cable connected to the t1_fpga system.

       After booting the system to console login prompt, login as root.

       Example network configuration:
       -----------------------------

	 new_ip_address:         192.10.10.100
	 new_broadcast_address:  192.10.10.255
	 new_gateway_address:    192.10.10.1
	 new_netmask:            255.255.255.0

       # ifconfig eth0 down
       # ifconfig eth0 inet <new_ip_address> broadcast <new_broadcast_address> netmask <new_netmask>
       # ifconfig eth0 up
       # route add default gw <new_gateway_address>

       Connect the ethernet cable to the network (ethernet switch)

1.5) How do I modify the ramdisk image

   On a (Ubuntu) Linux system, login to an account with root privileges.
   Make sure that the ramdisk file has write permissions so that root can modify the file.

   # mkdir <ramdisk_mnt_dir>
   # mount -o /dev/loop0 <ramdisk_image_pathname> <ramdisk_mnt_dir>
   # cd <ramdisk_mnt_dir>
   #
   # make changes. be careful not to modify the host system files.
   #
   # cd ..
   # sync
   # umount <ramdisk_mnt_dir> 


1.6) How do I add new commands to the ramdisk image

   Mount the ramdisk image and copy the files to the appropriate directory. Since the
   ramdisk image doesn't have all the libraries and files that come with Ubuntu Gutsy
   distribution, you may have to add any missing dependent files. You can use "ldd" 
   command to find the library dependencies of the new command.


1.7) How do I create a new ramdisk image with files from the existing ramdisk image

    On a Ubuntu Linux system, login to an account with root privileges.

    mkdir new_dir
    cd new_dir
    
    # copy ramdisk.ubuntu-7.10-gutsy.gz to the current directory
    gzip -d ramdisk.ubuntu-7.10-gutsy.gz
    
    dd if=ramdisk.ubuntu-7.10-gutsy of=vtoc count=1
    dd if=ramdisk.ubuntu-7.10-gutsy of=first.b skip=1 count=1
    
    mkdir old_mnt
    mount -o loop=/dev/loop0 ramdisk.ubuntu-7.10-gutsy  old_mnt
    cd old_mnt
    tar cf ../old_files.tar .
    cd ..
    sync; umount old_mnt
    
    dd if=/dev/zero of=new_ramdisk count=163840     # 80MB
    /sbin/mkfs -t ext3 -q new_ramdisk
    
    mkdir new_mnt
    mount -o loop=/dev/loop0 new_ramdisk  new_mnt
    cd new_mnt
    tar xf ../old_files.tar
    cd boot
    update_first_second ../../first.b ./second.b
    cd ../..
    dd if=first.b of=/dev/loop0 seek=1 count=1
    dd if=vtoc of=/dev/loop0 count=1
    sync
    umount new_mnt


1.8) How do I create a new ramdisk image from a SPARC system running Ubuntu Linux
     
    On a SPARC Ubuntu Linux system, login to an account with root privileges.
    This example uses "/dev/sdc" to represent the root device. Use a device path
    that is appropriate for your system.


    mkdir new_dir
    cd new_dir
    
    # copy ramdisk.ubuntu-7.10-gutsy.gz to the current directory

    gzip -d ramdisk.ubuntu-7.10-gutsy.gz
    dd if=ramdisk.ubuntu-7.10-gutsy of=vtoc count=1
    dd if=/dev/sdc of=first.b skip=1 count=1
    
    # create a tar file containing the files to be copied from the harddisk
    # to the ramdisk image. Use the list of files in the ramdisk image 
    # ramdisk.ubuntu-7.10-gutsy.gz to get an idea of the minimum required files.
    # Add sunhv_disk to initrd.img file.
    
    dd if=/dev/zero of=new_ramdisk count=163840     # 80MB
    /sbin/mkfs -t ext3 -q new_ramdisk
    
    mkdir new_mnt
    mount -o loop=/dev/loop0 new_ramdisk  new_mnt
    cd new_mnt
    tar xf ../old_files.tar
    #
    # Add the "sunhv_net" device driver to the new_ramdisk image in the same location
    # as in the file "ramdisk.ubuntu-7.10-gutsy.gz". Also add the device
    # driver module to /etc/modules.
    #
    cd boot
    update_first_second ../../first.b ./second.b
    cd ../..
    dd if=first.b of=/dev/loop0 seek=1 count=1
    dd if=vtoc of=/dev/loop0 count=1
    sync
    umount new_mnt


1.9) What changes have been made to the Ubuntu Linux kernel.

    The following two files have been modified in the kernel source code
    and the compiled kernel binary copied to the ramdisk image. The original 
    files, the new files and the diffs are available in the directory
    "niagara/design/sys/edk/os/Ubuntu/7.10-Gutsy/src/changes".

    drivers/serial/sunhv.c
    arch/sparc64/kernel/hvapi.c

    1)  sun4v console device used in the t1_fpga system doesn't support interrupts.
	Therefore the sun4v console driver in the kernel is modified to poll
	the console device periodically for input.

	drivers/serial/sunhv.c

    2)  The following file has been modified to specify the sun4v interrupt API
	version to be used.

	arch/sparc64/kernel/hvapi.c

1.10) What changes have been made to initrd.img

      initrd.img file in the ramdisk image is in uncompressed format. This is done to save
      time uncompressing the file in the t1_fpga system.

      The following three files have been modified in the initrd.img file so that the kernel
      uses "sunhv_disk" device driver for accessing the disk.

      conf/conf.d/resume
      conf/modules
      etc/udev/rules.d/65-persistent-storage.rules

1.11)  What are the files

      Ubuntu/7.10-Gutsy/src/utils/update_first_second.c
      Ubuntu/7.10-Gutsy/src/utils/create_vtoc.c


      update_first_second.c

	  This file is compiled and run on a Linux system.

	  update_first_second  <first.b_filename>  <second.b_filename>

	  The address of the first sector of the file /boot/second.b is hardcoded in the
	  last word of the second sector in the ramdisk image.

	  The addresses of the disk sectors used by the file /boot/second.b are stored at
	  the beginning of the file /boot/second.b

	  When a new ramdisk image is created, these disk sector numbers are likely to be
	  invalid and the utility updates these sector numbers to the correct values.


      create_vtoc.c

	  This file is compiled and run on a Solaris system.

	  create_vtoc -f <new_ramdisk_image_file>

	  This utility creates and writes the VTOC in the first sector of the ramdisk image.


1.12) What are the directories

      Ubuntu/7.10-Gutsy/src/drivers/sunhv_disk
      Ubuntu/7.10-Gutsy/src/drivers/sunhv_net


      These two directories contain the source code of the device drivers for disk and network 
      devices supported in the t1_fpga system respectively. The device drivers communicate with
      the virtual disk device and virtual network device which are then mapped to DRAM and real 
      network device on the fpga board respectively.

1.13) What messages appear on the console during Ubuntu Linux boot
