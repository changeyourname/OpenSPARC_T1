1.0) How do I connect the t1_fpga system to the network

   The default IP address and the network configuration may not be appropriate
   to the network to which the t1_fpga system is to be connected.

   There are two ways of changing the IP address and the network configuration of 
   the t1_fpga system.

   1) Permanently change the IP address and the network configuration in the ramdisk image.
   
       Modify the following files in the ramdisk image appropriately

       /etc/inet/hosts
       /etc/inet/netmasks
       /etc/defaultdomain
       /etc/defaultrouter
       /etc/hostname.snet0
       /etc/nodename

   2) Temporarily change the IP address and the network configuration after booting 
      the t1_fpga system with the default IP address and the network configuration.

       Disconnect the t1_fpga system from the network (from the ethernet switch)
       but keep the ethernet cable connected to the t1_fpga system.

       After booting the system to console prompt, login as root.
       Verify that all the services are online by using the command "svcs".

       Example network configuration:
       -----------------------------

	 new_ip_address:         192.10.10.100
	 new_broadcast_address:  192.10.10.255
	 new_gateway_address:    192.10.10.1
	 new_netmask:            255.255.255.0
	 new_domainname:         acme_company.com

       # ifconfig snet0 down
       # route -f
       # ifconfig snet0 inet <new_ip_address> broadcast <new_broadcast_address> netmask <new_netmask>
       # domainname   <new_domainname>
       # ifconfig snet0 up
       # route add default -gateway <new_gateway_address>

       Connect the ethernet cable to the network (ethernet switch)

1.1) What are the different boot options at OBP prompt

   a) boot -mverbose

      boots to multi-user-server mode and prints various OS services as they are started.

   b) boot -m milestone=none

      This is the fastest way to boot to login prompt and enable networking or run commands.

      boots to maintenance mode. The SMF services including network are not enabled. The root 
      filesystem is mounted in read-only mode. The following mount command can be used to remount
      the root file system in read/write mode.

      mount -F ufs -o remount /

      Network service can be started without booting to multi-user prompt from maintenance mode.

      # ifconfig snet0 plumb
      # ifconfig snet0 inet <ip_address> broadcast <broadcast_addr> netmask <netmask> ether <mac_addr>
      # ifconfig snet0 up
      # route -f 
      # route add default -gateway <router_ip_address>

      Example network configuration values:

      ip_address:          192.10.10.100
      broadcast_address:   192.10.10.255
      netmask:             255.255.255.0
      route_ip_address:    192.10.10.1



1.2) How do I disable the physical network interface

   remove or rename the file  /etc/hostname.snet0  in the ramdisk image.


1.3) Are all the services online when console login prompt is reached ?

   No. OpenSolaris could still be starting services. Use "svcs" command
   to see the status of different services. For example, telnet service
   may not yet have been enabled and could be in transition.


1.4) What network services are enabled by default.

   Only telnet service is enabled. telnet into the t1_fpga system is allowed. Login as root.
   Remote systems must be referred with IP addresses unless added to the /etc/inet/hosts file.

   "ftp" command can be run in the t1_fpga system and file transfers can be done between the
   fpga system and any remote system.


1.5) Can I use hostnames for other systems instead of IP addresses ?

    hostnames and their IP addresses can be added to /etc/hosts.

1.6) How do I modify the ramdisk image

   On a Solaris/OpenSolaris system, login to an account with root privileges.
   Make sure that ramdisk file has write permissions so that root can modify the file.

   # mkdir <ramdisk_mnt_dir>
   # lofiadm -a <ramdisk_image_pathname> /dev/lofi/1 
   # mount /dev/lofi/1 <ramdisk_mnt_dir>
   # cd <ramdisk_mnt_dir>
   #
   # make changes. be careful not to modify the host system files.
   #
   # cd /
   # umount <ramdisk_mnt_dir> 
   # lofiadm -d <ramdisk_image_pathname>


1.7) How do I add new commands to the ramdisk image

   Mount the ramdisk image and copy the files to the appropriate directory. Since the ramdisk image
   doesn't have all the libraries and files that come with OpenSolaris distribution, you may have to 
   add any missing dependent files. You can use "ldd" command to find the library dependencies of the
   new command.



1.8) How do I change OpenSPARC T1 DRAM size and/or OpenSolaris ramdisk size

   Files and the macros to be modified:
   -----------------------------------

   softsim/t1_fpga/src/xilinx/include/xilinx_t1_system_config.h

      - T1_FPGA_TOTAL_MEMSIZE

   niagara/design/sys/edk/ccx-firmware/src/mbfw_config.h

      - T1_DRAM_SIZE
      - T1_RAM_DISK_SIZE


   Any change to OpenSPARC T1 dram size or ramdisk size must satisfy the
   following two constraints.

   T1_FPGA_TOTAL_MEMSIZE == T1_DRAM_SIZE
   fpga_board_dram_size = microblaze_memory_size + T1_DRAM_SIZE + T1_RAM_DISK_SIZE + OpenSPARC_T1_prom_size

   Generate new PROM files following the instructions in softsim/README.t1_fpga


1.9) How do I change OpenSPARC T1 clock frequency as reported to the Operating System

   Files and the macros to be modified:
   -----------------------------------

   softsim/t1_fpga/src/xilinx/include/xilinx_t1_system_config.h

      - T1_FPGA_STICK_FREQ

   Generate new PROM files following the instructions in softsim/README.t1_fpga



2.0) The t1_fpga system doesn't seem to keep track of time correctly.

   OpenSolaris keeps track of time using the OpenSPARC T1 tick register. OpenSolaris has
   optimized the conversion of tick register values to nanoseconds and it makes an assumption
   that the OpenSPARC T1 frequently is atleast 62.5 MHz. The machine description in the
   PROM file specifies the OpenSPARC T1 frequency as 1GHz because of which 1 second in
   the t1_fpga system is actually (1GHz / (real OpenSPARC T1 frequency)) seconds.

   See question 7.0 also

2.1) There seems to be packet loss when I ping the system or try to transfer files between
   the t1_fpga system and a remote machine.

   This is a known issue and the problem was noticed when both the following conditions are true.

     1) xemaclite ethernet controller is used
     2) the t1_fpga system is connected to a busy network.

   The problem wasn't noticed under the following two conditions

     1) xemac ethernet controller is used

     2) xemaclite ethernet controller is used but the t1_fpga_system is connected to a private
	network with a small number of systems.



3.0) What other documentation is available on OpenSolaris/Solaris

     http://opensolaris.org
     http://docs.sun.com



4.0) What messages appear on the console during OpenSolaris boot

5.0) How do I enable networking if "ramdisk.snv-b77-nd.no-boot-time-network.gz"
     is used for booting OpenSolaris

    # ifconfig snet0 plumb
    # ifconfig snet0 inet <ip_addr> broadcast <broadcast_addr> netmask <netmask> ether <mac_addr>
    # ifconfig snet0 up
    # route -f 
    # route add default -gateway <router_ip_addr>

6.0) What is the difference between "ramdisk.snv-b77-nd.no-boot-time-network.gz" and 
     "ramdisk.snv-b77-nd.gz"
     
    In "ramdisk.snv-b77-nd.no-boot-time-network.gz", the file /etc/hostname.snet0
    is renamed to /etc/disable.hostname.snet0 . Therefore network is not enabled during
    the boot process.

    For booting Opensolaris on the dual-core system, it is advised to use the ramdisk image
    "ramdisk.snv-b77-nd.no-boot-time-network.gz". Occasionally the dual-core system hangs
    if networking is enabled. Single core system works fine.

7.0) Why is the CPU clock frequency as reported to the Operating System set to 1GHz

    There are instances in the OS where a response is expected in Y amount of time.
    If the response is not received in Y amount of time, a timeout occurs. Since the
    memory subsystem in the OpenSPARC T1 fpga system is slow, OS timeout happens. This
    can result in a panic or unexpected behavior. This behavior is more pronounced in
    the dual-core system.

    The real CPU clock frequency is 50MHz. The net effect of specifying a 1GHz clock frequency
    is that, the time in the fpga system is 20 times slower than the wall clock time. The
    effective timeout is now 20 * Y.
